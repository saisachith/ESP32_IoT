# ESP32_WiFi_webserver
For this first compile and upload the code into the esp32.
In the code we wanted it to be simple and chose only two options in the server i.e LED ON and LED OFF.
So When you press LED ON button the LED connected to the PIN 2 i.e. here blue LED will glow and for switching it off you need to press the button LED OFF.

When connected to your ESP32 WiFi for IP address go to your command prompt and know your IP i.e. 

Command : ipconfig

The you get something like this:

And the Webserver Interface Will be something like this:
